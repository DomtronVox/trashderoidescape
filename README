You've crashed into a ball of trash while in the depths of the interplanetary void. Patch up your rocket by digging out materials from the scraps.

Small game created over two-ish weeks for the 2025 Spring Redot "gam jam"[sic]. It's not much, only had a few hours a night to work on it. But at least it's a complete MVP so I'm personally happy with it. Had some ideas to extend it, but didn't get that far.

Instructions: 

* Click and hold the mouse over trashpiles to gather materials.
* Once you have the requested amount click the button to fix a stage of your ship.
* Launch your ship to win.
